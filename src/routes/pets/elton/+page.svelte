        Elton, born as "Nuisance," found his forever home through Furever Homes Cat Rescue. This
        dapper tuxedo cat, born on April Fools' Day 2024, brings daily joy and mischief to his
        family alongside his beloved sister <a href="/cats/moog">Moog</a>. His formal black and
        white attire belies his playful nature.

        When not engaged in his favorite pastime of toe ambushes, Elton can be found pursuing his
        cherished string-on-a-stick with remarkable agility and determination. His hunting prowess
        is legendary, though his preferred prey tends to be a well-loved stuffed squid that has
        become his constant companion.

        Despite his initial "Nuisance" moniker, Elton has proven himself to be anything but -
        transforming into a charming and entertaining family member. His synchronized play sessions
        with Moog and his strategic toe-attacking campaigns keep his humans constantly amused and on
        their toes, quite literally.
