        Eno was Toki's sister and protector. I remember the first time meeting Eno and Toki at
        Emily's apartment. Eno came out from under the couch to check me out and determined I was
        worthy of petting her. She was usually happy to meet whoever came over to the house.

        Eno would love to flop around on the floor knowing I'd get up to rub her soft belly. She
        loved catnip and playing. She was an apt huntress too, quick to take down black flies that
        would sneak in from the back yard. She had her agile years, capable of getting up to trouble
        high on cabinets, toppling a pizza, spilling a pint of curry or picking through the stir-fry.

        Later in life Eno would keep me company while I worked from home, chirping at the birds
        nesting in the branch just outside the window. Eno learned to ask for food or treats with
        just the right meow. She'd sing too, especially on trips to the vet. She'd sing "AAAAron
        oooooh nooo." My favorite feeling in the world was holding her in my arms.

        Eno was a great cat and companion.
