        Originally named Critter, Moog is a petite tuxedo cat with an outsized personality. Despite
        her small stature, she's full of energy and charm. She loves to play fetch with her string
        of felt balls and climb on shoulders like a tiny parrot.

        When she's not perched up high, you can find her warming up by the fireplace or patiently
        waiting for her food. She shares her home with her brother
