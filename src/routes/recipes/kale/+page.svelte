			<h2 class="subheading">Ingredients</h2>
			<ul class="body">
				<li>1 large bag pre-cut and washed kale</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons coarse salt</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic</li>
				<li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
				<li>Olive oil (generous amount)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="subheading">Instructions</h2>
			<p class="body large-letter">
				Begin by sorting through your kale, removing any remaining stems or imperfect pieces. In a spacious 
				bowl, combine all ingredients and dive in with clean hands to massage the kale leaves thoroughly.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				The key is to really work the leaves, squeezing and compacting them to break down their fibrous 
				structure. Let the mixture rest for an hour if possible, allowing the flavors to meld. Finally, 
				transfer to a large wok and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until the kale has reduced 
				significantly in volume and reached your desired tenderness.
